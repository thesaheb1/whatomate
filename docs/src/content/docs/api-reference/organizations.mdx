## Overview

Whatomate is multi-tenant — each organization has its own isolated data (contacts, conversations, templates, etc.). Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles in each.

## List Organizations

Retrieve all organizations. Requires super admin or `organizations:read` permission.

```bash
GET /api/organizations
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "organizations": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "name": "Acme Corp",
        "slug": "acme-corp-a1b2c3d4",
        "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Get Current Organization

Retrieve the current organization's details.

```bash
GET /api/organizations/current
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "slug": "acme-corp-a1b2c3d4",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Create Organization

Create a new organization. The creator is automatically added as an admin. System roles (Admin, Manager, Agent) and default chatbot settings are seeded automatically.

```bash
POST /api/organizations
```

<Aside type="note">
  Requires `organizations:write` permission.
</Aside>

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "New Organization"
}
```

    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }

```

## Organization Members

### Update Member Role

Change a member's role within the organization.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {

  }
}
```

```bash
DELETE /api/organizations/members/{member_id}
```

<Aside type="note">
  Requires `organizations:assign` permission.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
  You cannot remove yourself from the organization.
